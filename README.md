# Ultraviolet
Ultraviolet is a Blender theme with a focus on minimalism and clarity - contrasting well-calibrated greyscale menu colours with a high-visibility violet selection and highlight colour.  Additional colours like axis highlights, node headers and other UI assets have also been tweaked to remain bold and visible, while feeling more subtle and complimentary to the theme as a whole.

This theme was originally built from Ubuntu Ambiance, and something i've been slowly working on for a while.  It also needs more work, specifically in areas like animation and video editing.  Any feedback would be greatly appreciated :)
